SetThermalCal
void SetThermalCal(int iCtrl1, int iProbe1, int iCtrl2, int iProbe2);
Sets the thermal calibration parameters in Shadow EEPROM.
WriteEEPROM() must be called to make this setting permanent.

Parameters:
iCtrl1 - The first control temperature (in 100ths of degree Celsius). This is the setpoint temperature at thermal calibration time.
iProbe1 - The thermal-meter reading (in 100ths of degree Celsius) when the module is at setpoint iCtrl1.
iCtrl2 - The second control temperature (in 100ths of degree Celsius). This is the setpoint temperature at thermal calibration time.
iProbe2 - The thermal-meter reading (in 100ths of degree Celsius) when the module is at setpoint iCtrl2.

Notes
When SetThermalCal() is called, the calender date (taken from the PC's clock) is also written to Shadow EEPROM.
Setting all four parameters to zero will turn thermal calibration off.
Example
SetThermalCal(2500, 2480, 8000, 7980);
This sets the thermal calibration parameters to indicate that when the module was at 25.00°C, the thermal meter read 24.80°C, and when the module was at 80.00°C, the thermal meter read 79.80°C.
This indicates a thermal meter that reads 0.20°C low across the range from 25.00°C to 80.00°C.  After calling this function, WriteEEPROM() must be called to make the setting permanent.
